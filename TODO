TODO List:

Change board class to an actual board (64 spaces)
Create class <game> or sth to replace current functions in board.hpp
Create differant movetypes (maybe as enum) that return a vector of movements
Create for class <game> a way to load the starting chess board
Calculation of legal moves with help of movetypes and board
Create class for visualising board (terminal and eventually gfx)
